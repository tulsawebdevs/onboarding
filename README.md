# Onboarding
A Repo for documenting processes and storing resources related to welcoming new attendees and onboarding new project contributors and maintainers.

## Project Onboarding Overview
- 20-25 min process maximum
- Leadable by 1 person who knows the process / project
- Asess skill levels and interests (TODO - link process doc)
- Assign each person a ticket:
    - Try to match skill level and interest
    - Everyone gets a buddy - so either pair new person with returner/maintainer or another new person
- Initial tasks should be small enough in scale to get all new people to commit a contribution by the end of the night
*Returners not involved in onboarding will do a project 'standup' and/or socialize during this time
